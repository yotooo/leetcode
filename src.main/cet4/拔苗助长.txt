从前有个农夫嫌他种的禾苗长得慢，就到地里把禾苗一株株地拔高了一点。
回家后他对家人说：“今天可真把我累坏了！但我总算让禾苗一下子长高了。
“他儿子到地里去一看，禾苗都已死光了。
现在有些家长急于让孩子成功，往往步那个农夫的后尘，搞得孩子苦不堪言，却不见孩子学业长进。
这样的家长是否该对这个问题有所醒悟，让孩子自然成长呢？


A farmer lift all the grain in the ground because he think it's so slow for growth.
After back to home,he said "I'm so tired!But the grain be high ultimately!"
All the grain died after his son go to ground.
Many parents are so hurry to see the children of success that they like the farmer,which not only make children sad
but also no improvement of study.
Can which parents think of this question and let kids grow by nature?


译文:
Once upon a time, a farmer, who thought that the seedlings he planted grew too slowly,
went to the field and pulled them up a bit one by one. Back home, he told his family,
“ How exhausted I am today! But I have finally managed to make the seedlings grow taller all at once.”
His son went to the field to take a look, and found that the seedlings had all died.
Now some parents are so eager to make their children succeed that they often follow the farmer’s footsteps,
making their kids suffer a lot without any progress in their schoolwork.
Should such parents wake up to the problem and let children grow naturally.
